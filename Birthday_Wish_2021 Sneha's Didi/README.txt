Welcome Orpita!
Just Follow What I say...

1. Open "bin" file.
2. Open "Release" file.
3. Double click on "Birthday_Wish_2021.exe".
4. When the window appears just maximize it, or in other words, make it full screen.
5. You can open the "OPEN_ME" folder.
6. If you face any difficulties, call me.

[Note : You'll find "(y/n)" kind of staffs all over the window. Here y means YES n means NO, & you have to give your opinion by pressing just y or n to continue there in the window after double clicking. GOOD LUCK!]

Thank You :)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
